- **Dependencies**: This application depends on the Gemini API from Google Generative AI.
- **Environment**: The application is designed to run on Google Colaboratory.
- **HTML Output**: The SWOT analysis output is provided in an interactive HTML format for better visualization.
- **GitHub Rendering**: GitHub does not render HTML files with the same level of interactivity and styling as a web browser. When viewing HTML files on GitHub, they are displayed as static documents without any dynamic elements, such as JavaScript functionality or CSS styling. As a result, the formatting, colors, and styles applied to the SWOT analysis in the HTML output may not be fully represented when viewed directly on GitHub.
